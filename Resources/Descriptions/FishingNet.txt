Whether it be dredging, trawling, or purse seining, there are many large scale fishing practices that are incredibly unsustainable in many global fisheries. Growing human demand for fish have caused fishermen to start dragging large nets across the ocean floor, destroying ecosystems and killing thousands of sea creatures just to send a small percentage of the caught fish to market. If sustainsable fish practices aren't enforced the oceans will be emptied and fish we eat every day will go extinct.
