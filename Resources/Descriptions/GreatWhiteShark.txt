The Great White Shark is the largest shark on Earth today. Despite the bad publicity, you are 75 times more likely to be struck by lightning than attacked by this creature (University of Florida). They are frequently hunted and killed just so their fins can be used for shark fin soup. An estimated 100 million sharks are killed annually to supply fins for soup (Smithsonian).
