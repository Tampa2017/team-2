Only 5% of plastics are recycled worldwide. The rest ends up in landfills and the oceans. Over eight million tons of plastic are dumped in the oceans every year (Plastic Oceans Foundation). About 57% of these plastics are plastic bottles. Just the process of bottling water takes about six times the amount of water that will even fill the container. Switching to tap can make a huge difference!
