We had issues connecting to our mongo database. An instance was running that needed to be killed and couldn't be killed without sudo access.
This blocked us from continuing in the same direction with use of the database as a way to get the necessary information to the webpage. 
We then shifted to storing a small amount of data in the same directory as all the code so the resources could just be loaded and called upon locally. 
This is less scalable and forced us to invest all of our time and effort into the html/css of the project, but was the only workaround for our blocker until 
we could get help.
